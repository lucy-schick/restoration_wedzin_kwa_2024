# Background

## Project Location

This project includes the Widzin Kwah (Morice River) and Neexdzii Kwah (Upper Bulkley River), as well as a small portion of the Lower Widzin Kwah (Lower Bulkley River) [@WidzinKwahWaterSustainabilityProject]. The project's western limit is defined by the headwaters of the Widzin Kwah (Widzin Bin/Morice Lake), which flows northeast and converges with the Upper Bulkley River near the District of Houston. The southern boundary of the project area separates the Morice and Bulkley River systems from the Stuart-Nechako watershed [@WidzinKwahWaterSustainabilityProject].

### Neexdzii Kwah (Upper Buklkey River)

The Neexdzii Kwah (Upper Bukley River) is an 8th order stream that drains an area of `r fwapgr::fwa_watershed_at_measure(360873822) %>% mutate(area_km2 = round(area_ha/100, 1)) %>% pull(area_km2)` km^2^ in a generally northerly direction from Bulkley Lake on the Nechako Plateau to its confluence with the Widzin Kwah (Morice River) near Houston [@WidzinKwahWaterSustainabilityProject]. It has a mean annual discharge of `r round(fasstr::calc_longterm_mean(station_number = "08EE003")$LTMAD,1)` m^3^/s at station 08EE003 located near Houston. The hydrograph peaks around May - June during the spring freshet with additional peaks related to significant rain events for the Upper Bulkley River (Figures \@ref(fig:hydrograph1) and \@ref(fig:hydrology-stats1))[@westcott2022UpperBulkley]. Below the Morice confluence is the Lower Widzin Kwah (Lower Bulkley River) which flows in a northwesterly direction to its confluence with the Skeena River in Hazleton, but only a small section is included in the project study area [@WidzinKwahWaterSustainabilityProject].

### Buck Creek
Buck Creek is a 5th order stream which joins the Upper Bulkley River just upstream of the Morice Bulkley confluence and drains an area of `r fwapgr::fwa_watershed_at_measure(360886221) %>% mutate(area_km2 = round(area_ha/100, 1)) %>% pull(area_km2)` km^2^. Buck Creek is one of the main tributaries to the Upper Bulkley River and has a mean annual discharge of `r round(fasstr::calc_longterm_mean(station_number = "08EE013")$LTMAD,1)` m^3^/s at station 08EE013 located near the Houston Medical Centre approximately one km upstream of the mouth [@westcott2022UpperBulkley]. Flows from Buck Creek account for just under 1/3 of the total flows in the Upper Bulkley River. The hydrograph for Buck Creek shows a similar pattern to the Upper Bulkley River with peak flows in May - June (Figures \@ref(fig:hydrograph2) and \@ref(fig:hydrology-stats2)).

McQuarrie Creek is a 5th order stream that flows into the Upper Bulkley River ~20 km upstream of Houston, and drains an area of `r fwapgr::fwa_watershed_at_measure(360875378) %>% mutate(area_km2 = round(area_ha/100, 1)) %>% pull(area_km2)` km^2^. There is one hydrometric station on McQuarrie Creek deployed by the BC Ministry of Forests, Land, Natural Resource Operations and Rural Development Groundwater Program (FLNRORD) which was was active from 2016-2018 but has very few data[@westcott2022UpperBulkley]. An estimate of mean annual discharge for the two years of available data is `r round(fasstr::calc_longterm_mean(mq_clean),1)` m^3^/s at station 08EE0002 located near the mouth of the creek. Based of the limited data, the hydrograph for McQuarrie Creek during this time period peaks rapidly in May and again in the winter (Figures \@ref(fig:hydrograph3)).

```{r, eval = F}

Changes to the climate systems are causing impacts to natural and human systems on all continents with alterations to hydrological systems caused by changing precipitation or melting snow and ice increasing the frequency and magnitude of extreme events such as floods and droughts [@ClimateChange2014SynthesisReportGenevaSwitzerlandIntergovernmentalPanelClimateChangeIPCC2014; @eccc2016Climatedataa]. These changes are resulting in modifications to the quantity and quality of water resources throughout British Columbia and are likely to compound issues related to drought and flooding in the Bulkley River watershed where numerous water licenses are held with a potential over-allocation of flows identified during low flow periods [@ilmb2007MoriceLanda].

### Widzin Kwah (Morice River)

The Widzin Kwah (Morice River) watershed drains `r fwapgr::fwa_watershed_at_measure(360885316) %>% mutate(area_km2 = round(area_ha/100, 1)) %>% pull(area_km2)` km^2^ of Coast Mountains and Interior Plateau in a generally south-eastern direction. The Morice River is an 8th order stream that flows approximatley 80km from Widzin Bin (Morice Lake) to the confluence with the upper Bulkley River just north of Houston. Major tributaries include the Nanika River, the Atna River, Gosnell Creek and the Thautil River. There area numerous large lakes situated on the south side of the watershed including Morice Lake, McBride Lake, Stepp Lake, Nanika Lake, Kid Price Lake, Owen Lake and others. There is one active hydrometric station on the mainstem of the Morice River near the outlet of Morice Lake and one historic station that was located at the mouth of the river near Houston that gathered data in 1971 only [@canada2010NationalWater]. An estimate of mean annual discharge for the one year of data available for the Morice near it's confluence with the Bulkley River is `r round(fasstr::calc_longterm_mean(station_number = "08ED003")$LTMAD,1)` m^3^/s. Mean annual discharge is estimated at `r round(fasstr::calc_longterm_mean(station_number = "08ED002")$LTMAD,1)` m^3^/s at station 08ED002 located near the outlet of Morice Lake. Flow patterns are typical of high elevation watersheds influenced by coastal weather patterns which receive large amounts of winter precipitation as snow in the winter and large precipitation events in the fall. This leads to peak levels of discharge during snowmelt, typically from May to July with isolated high flows related to rain and rain on snow events common in the fall (Figures \@ref(fig:hydrograph4) - \@ref(fig:hydrology-stats4)).

## Fisheries

### Bulkley River

Traditionally, the salmon stocks passing through and spawning in Bulkley River were the principal food source for the Gitxsan and Wet’suwet’en people living there [@wilson_rabnett2007FishPassage]. @wilson_rabnett2007FishPassage detail numerous fishing  areas located within the lower Bulkley drainage (from  the confluence of the Skeena to the confluence with the Telkwa River) and the upper Bulkley drainage which includes the mainstem Bulkley River and tributaries upstream of the Telkwa River confluence. Anadromous lamprey passing through and spawning in the upper Bulkley River were traditionally also an important food source for the Wet'suwet'en  (Wilson and Rabnett 2007; pers comm. Mike Ridsdale, Environmental Assessment Coordinator, Office of the Wet'suwet'en).

<br>

 
Approximately 11.3 km downstream of the Bulkley Lake outlet and just upstream of Watson Creek, the upper Bulkley falls is an approximately 4m high narrow rock sill that crosses the Bulkley River, producing a steep cascade section.  This obstacle to fish passage is recorded as an almost complete barrier to fish passage for salmon during low water flows.  Coho have not been observed beyond the falls since 1972 [@wilson_rabnett2007FishPassage].

<br>

Renowned as a world class recreational steelhead and coho fishery, the Bulkley River receives some of the heaviest angling pressure in the province.  In response to longstanding angler concerns with respect to overcrowding, quality of experience and conflict amongst anglers, an Angling Management Plan was drafted for the river following the initiation of the Skeena Quality Waters Strategy process in 2006 and an extensive multi-year consultation process.   The plan  introduces a number of  regulatory measures with the intent to provide Canadian resident anglers with quality steelhead fishing opportunities.  Regulatory measures introduced with the Angling Management Plan include prohibited angling for non-guided non-resident aliens on Saturdays and Sundays, Sept 1 - Oct 31 within the Bulkley River, angling prohibited for non-guided non-resident aliens on Saturdays and Sundays, all year within the Suskwa River and angling prohibited for non-guided non-resident aliens Sept 1 - Oct 31 in the Telkwa River.  The Bukley River is considered Class II waterand there is no fshing permitted upstream of the Morice/Bulkley River Confluence [@flnro2013BulkleyRiver; @flnro2013OverviewAngling; @flnrord2019FreshwaterFishing].

<br>

### Morice River

Detailed reviews of Morice River watershed fisheries can be found in @bustard_schell2002ConservingMorice,  @gottesfeld_etal2002ConservingSkeena, @schell2003BriefOverview, @gottesfeld_rabnett2007SkeenaFish, and @ilmb2007MoriceLand with a comprehensive review of water quality by @oliver2018Analysiswater.  Overall, the Morice watershed contains high fisheries values as a major producer of chinook, pink, sockeye, coho and steelhead.  

<br>

#### Fish Species

Fish species recorded in the Bulkley River and Morice River watershed groups are detailed in Table \@ref(tab:fiss-species-table) [@data_fish_obs].  Coastal cutthrout trout and bull trout are considered of special concern (blue-listed) provincially. Summaries of some of the MORICE and Bulkley River fish species life history, biology, stock status, and traditional use are documented in  @schell2003BriefOverview,  @wilson_rabnett2007FishPassage,   @gottesfeld_etal2002ConservingSkeena and @officeofthewetsuweten2013Wetsuwet.  @wilson_rabnett2007FishPassage discuss chinook, pink, sockeye, coho, steelhead and indigenous freshwater Bulkley River fish stocks within the context of key lower and upper Bulkley River habitats such as the Suskwa River, Station  Creek,  Harold  Price  Creek,  Telkwa  River  and  Buck  Creek. Key  areas  within  the  upper  Bulkley River  watershed  with  high  fishery  values,   documented  in  @schell2003BriefOverview,  are  the  upper  Bulkley mainstem, Buck Creek,  Dungate Creek, Barren Creek, McQuarrie Creek, Byman Creek, Richfield Creek, Johnny David Creek, Aitken Creek and Emerson Creek. Some areas of high fisheries values for chinook, sockeye and coho are noted in @bustard_schell2002ConservingMorice as McBride Lake, Nanika Lake, and Morice Lake watersheds.
<br>

In the 1990's the Morice River watershed, @gottesfeld_rabnett2007SkeenaFish estimated that chinook comprised 30% of the total Skeena system chinook escapements. It is estimated that Morice River coho comprise approximatley 4% of the Skeena escapement with a declining trend noted since the 1950 in @gottesfeld_rabnett2007SkeenaFish.  Coho spawn in major tributaries and small streams ideally at locations where downstream dispersal can result in seeding of prime off channel habitats including warm productive sloughs and side channels.  Of all the salmon species, coho rely on small tributaries the most [@bustard_schell2002ConservingMorice]. @bustard_schell2002ConservingMorice report that much of the distribution of coho into non-natal tributaries occurs during high flow periods of May - early July with road culverts blocking migration into these habitats.

## Restoration 

### Stage 0
The Stream Evolution Model (SEM) is used to understanding how the morphology of channels (such as rivers or streams) respond to disturbances like changes in base level, channelization, or alterations in flow and sediment regimes (Figure \@ref(fig:SEM-stages))[@cluer_thorne2014StreamEvolution]. An important features of the SEM is the inclusion of stage 0, which represents the state of the river before disturbances and is categorized as either an anastomosing wet woodland or an anastomosing grassed wetland (Figure \@ref(fig:SEM-stages))[@cluer_thorne2014StreamEvolution].

```{r SEM-stages, fig.cap = 'Cluer and Thorne’s (2014) stream evolution model which introduced stage 0, a stage that represents the state of the river before disturbances.',eval=T}
knitr::include_graphics("fig/SEM_stages.png")
```



The SEM also assigns a hydrogeomorphic attributes and habitat and ecosystem benefits score to each stage (Figure \@ref(fig:SEM-hab-benifits)). Stage 0 is the ultimate restoration goal, but the SEM suggests that there is a big difference in performance between disconnected and incised streams (stages 3-6) and connected streams (stages 7-1), and that stages 7-1 are the best targets for restoration because they have the highest ecosystem potential (Figure \@ref(fig:SEM-hab-benifits))[@cluer_thorne2014StreamEvolution].

```{r SEM-hab-benifits, fig.cap = 'Habitat and ecosystem benifits as well as hydrogeomorphic attributes associated with each stage of the SEM, suggesting that stages 7-1 have the highest ecosystem potential (Cluer and Thorne, 2014).',eval=T}

knitr::include_graphics("fig/benefits.png")
```



### Process-based Restoration

Process-based restoration is a relatively new approach to river restoration and is based on the understanding that river form and function is driven by the physical, chemical, and biological processes that take place within them [@beechieProcessbasedPrinciplesRestoring2010]. Together, these processes shape rivers and flood planes, which is known as a riverscape [@shahverdian_etal2019ChapterBackground]. The goal of process-based restoration is to restore these processes to their the natural rates and magnitudes (essentially stage 0), which leads to the system restoring itself through biological processes and requires minimal corrective intervention [@ciottiDesignCriteriaProcessBased2021a, @polvi_wohl2013BioticDrivers]. This approach is in contrast to traditional river restoration, which focuses on restoring uniform and static form to the river, such as the channel shape, and is often done through hard engineering and has high costs [@beechieProcessbasedPrinciplesRestoring2010]. 

Below is an example of process-based restoration using stage 0 methodology done at Deer Creek in Oregon, USA. In this project they filled in incised channels and added large wood to to the river to restore the natural floodplain elevation and re-establish multiple channels (Figure \@ref(fig:deer-creek-plan))[@meyer2018DeerCreek]. Although this project used relatively aggressive restoration techniques, they observed immediate improvements and the benefits were self-sustaining (Figure \@ref(fig:deer-creek-action))[@meyer2018DeerCreek].

```{r deer-creek-plan, fig.cap = 'An example of process-based restoration using stage 0 methodology to restored the natural floodplain elevation. In this project they filled in incised channels and added large wood to restore the natural floodplain elevation and re-establish multiple channels (Meyer, 2018).',eval=T}
knitr::include_graphics("fig/stage0_before_after.png")
```

```{r deer-creek-action, fig.cap = 'Before and after restoration took place at Deer Creek, USA. They observed imediate improvements to the habitat and the benefits were self-sustaining (Meyer, 2018).',eval=T}
knitr::include_graphics("fig/deer_creek_before_after.png")
```



Process-based restoration also includes many low-cost and low-tech restoration techniques. Resources are sourced from near-by areas, and the restoration is often done by hand, which makes it more accessible to a broad audience and can be done on a smaller scale [@shahverdian_etal2019ChapterBackground]. The primary goal of low-tech restoration is to improve the health of as many riverscapes possible by "letting the system do the work" [@shahverdian_etal2019ChapterBackground].

Low-cost process-based restoration could be an applicable in the Upper Bulkely riverscape. Some examples of low-cost restoration techniques include:

* Grazing management
* Riparian planting
* Post-assisted log structures (PALS)
* Beaver damn analogs (BDAs)

There is some great information and examples of low-cost process-based restoration being done in the United States [here](https://lowtechpbr.restoration.usu.edu/workshops/2020/SGI/Modules/module1)
